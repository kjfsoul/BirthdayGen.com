- Personalized, professional results

## Immediate Technical Priorities

### P0 (Working/Optimized)
1. **Optimize build system configuration** - Improve development experience
2. **Verify component integration** - Ensure all components work together
3. **Performance optimization** - Enhance build and runtime performance

### P1 (Core Functionality) 
1. **Complete card sending pipeline** - Core user journey incomplete
2. **AI image generation reliability** - Key differentiation feature
3. **Template system consistency** - Multiple data sources causing conflicts

### P2 (User Experience)
1. **Canvas performance optimization** - Primary creation interface
2. **Mobile responsiveness** - Accessibility and usage patterns
3. **Error handling and recovery** - Production readiness

## Success Metrics (Current Context)

### Technical Metrics
