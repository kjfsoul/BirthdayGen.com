**ACTIVATE ULTRATHINK PROTOCOL: GRAND ARCHITECT**

**CURRENT STATE:** We have successfully audited the system.

1. **Protocol:** `ULTRATHINK.md` is active.
2. **Strategy:** `docs/audit/MEMORY_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md` defines the gaps.
3. **Reality:** `.audit/LIVING_AUDIT.md` defines the actual file structure.
4. **Compliance:** `docs/audit/VIOLATION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` is the standard for
   completion.

**YOUR OBJECTIVE:** You are the **Lead Architect**. You must ingest these four
files immediately. You are responsible for transforming this passive audit data
into an active, parallelized execution strategy.

**CONSTRAINT:** Do not generate code yet. Do not chat. Simply acknowledge you
have parsed the "Source of Truth" files and state that you are ready to generate
the **Master Execution Plan**.
