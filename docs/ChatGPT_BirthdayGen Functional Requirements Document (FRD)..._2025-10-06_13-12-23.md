    4\. Use‑Case Scenarios
    ----------------------
    
    ### 4.1 Individual User Journey
    
    1.  **Sign up and Onboard.** The user registers with email/password, completes the aura quiz and imports contacts (CSV or Google). They select card templates for sample cards and toggle automation.
        
    2.  **Create & Send Card.** The user chooses a contact, enters a personalized message, optionally generates AI artwork, previews the card in real time and saves/sends it via email.
        
    3.  **Schedule & Automate.** The user schedules future cards or enables auto‑send; the automation engine sends cards on the event date and notifies the user.
        
    4.  **Engage & Play.** The user visits the arcade to play mini‑games, earning streaks and unlocking rewards.
        
    
    ### 4.2 B2B Customer Journey (Future)
    
    1.  **Organization Setup.** An HR manager signs up, creates an organization, invites team members and configures branding and templates for employee cards.
        
    2.  **Employee Import.** The manager imports employees via CSV or HRIS integration and sets default celebration tiers and channels.
        
    3.  **Automated Celebrations.** The multi‑agent system generates personalized cards and messages for each employee and delivers them via email, Slack or physical mail with analytics on engagement.
        
    4.  **Relationship Insights.** Managers view dashboards showing relationship health metrics, pending events and suggestions for employee appreciation.
        
    
    5\. Future Enhancements
    -----------------------
    
    *   **Multi‑Agent Creative AI.** Implement autonomous agents to handle personalization tasks, ensuring 90 %+ approval rate without manual edits.
        
    *   **Predictive Relationship Intelligence.** Use ML models to predict relationship milestones and recommend actions.

    BirthdayGen Process & Architecture Document (PFD)
    =================================================
    
    1\. System Architecture Overview
    --------------------------------
    
    BirthdayGen is built as a client‑heavy Single Page Application (SPA) using **React + Vite** and the **shadcn/ui** component library. There is no traditional server; instead, the application relies on **Supabase** for authentication, database, storage and serverless functions. The key architectural components are:
    
    1.  **Frontend (React SPA)** – Presents the user interface, manages state, communicates with Supabase via its JavaScript client and handles real‑time previews. It loads card templates, runs the aura quiz and interacts with AI functions.
        
    2.  **Supabase Services** – Provides:
        
        *   **Auth**: email/password login and (future) social OAuth.
            
        *   **Database**: Postgres tables for users, contacts, cards, aura quiz responses, gift recommendations and (future) organizations.
            
        *   **Row‑Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures that each user only accesses their own data.
            
        *   **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for card CRUD operations, email sending, AI image generation, agent orchestration and Stripe checkout.
            
        *   **Storage**: Stores card images, AI‑generated images and user‑uploaded assets.
            
    3.  **AI Services** – Integrations with AI image models (OpenAI DALL‑E, local Stable Diffusion via AUTOMATIC1111/SDXL) and text models for personalization and prompts. These are invoked from edge functions or the client.
        
    4.  **External APIs & Integrations** – Google People API for contact import, email delivery provider (Resend or SendGrid) for sending cards, Stripe for payment and subscription management, Twilio for future SMS delivery, Slack/Microsoft Teams webhooks for B2B notifications.
        
    5.  **Future Agent Platform** – A multi‑agent orchestration layer built with CrewAI; each agent (Creative Director, Content Writer, Image Artist, Relationship Analyst, Delivery Coordinator, Quality Controller) is responsible for a specific part of the personalization workflow.
        
    
    2\. Major Process Flows
    -----------------------
    
    ### 2.1 Onboarding & Setup Flow
    
    The onboarding flow aims to get new users from sign‑up to first automation within five minutes:
    
    1.  **Sign Up:** User registers via email/password (future: social login). Supabase creates a user record.
        
    2.  **Aura Quiz:** Immediately after sign‑up, the app launches a short personality quiz; the resulting aura type is stored in the `users` table.
        
    3.  **Contact Import:** User imports contacts via CSV or Google People API. The system parses the data and inserts rows into `contacts`.
        
    4.  **Sample Card Generation:** AI generates a few sample cards for the first few contacts (optional, uses the user’s aura and contact info). The user can preview and tweak these samples.
        
    5.  **Automation Setup:** A simple toggle enables auto‑sending of cards for upcoming birthdays; the user can adjust tiers (message, card, card + gift) and scheduling preferences.
        
    6.  **Confirmation:** The app confirms upcoming birthdays and shows the user a dashboard with upcoming events.
        
    
    ### 2.2 Card Creation & Customization Flow
    
    1.  **Template Selection:** User chooses a base template from the library (cosmic, minimal, playful, elegant etc.).
        
    2.  **Message Editing:** User writes or edits the greeting; optionally uses AI to suggest personalized text based on aura and relationship.
        
    3.  **Artwork Generation:** If the user requests AI artwork, the frontend calls a Supabase edge function (`generate-ai-image`) which invokes the selected model (OpenAI DALL‑E or local SDXL). If the primary service fails, fallback images are used.
        
    4.  **Real‑Time Preview:** The UI updates the card preview live as the user changes text, colors, fonts and images.
        
    5.  **Save or Schedule:** The user can save the card as a draft, schedule it for a specific date/time or send it immediately. The card metadata is stored in the `cards` table with `status` (draft/scheduled/sent) and `scheduled_at` fields.
        
    6.  **Send:** For an immediate send, the frontend calls `send-card` edge function, which retrieves card content, contacts the email service (e.g., Resend) and logs the delivery in a `deliveries` table.
        
    
    ### 2.3 Contact Import Flow
    
    1.  **Initiate Import:** User clicks “Import Contacts.” If CSV, they upload a file; if Google, they trigger OAuth (requires Google OAuth credentials). The UI calls `/api/import/google/start` to obtain a URL and redirects.
        
    2.  **OAuth Callback:** After authentication, Google redirects to `/api/import/callback/google`, passing an authorization code. The API exchanges the code for an access token and calls People API to fetch contacts.
        
    3.  **Data Parsing & Storage:** Extract names and birthdays, map them to our contact schema and insert into `contacts` table. Duplicate checks are performed to avoid duplicate entries.
        
    4.  **User Feedback:** Provide progress and success messages; show imported contacts on the dashboard.
        
    
    ### 2.4 Automation & Delivery Flow
    
    1.  **Configure Automation Rules:** Each contact row has a toggle for “Auto‑send on birthday” and a selection of the tier (message only, card, card + gift). Settings are saved in the `contacts` table or an `automations` table with the user ID, contact ID and tier.
        
    2.  **Scheduled Job:** A Supabase scheduled function (`send-due-cards`) runs daily at midnight. It queries contacts whose birthday matches today and whose `auto_send_enabled` is true, then loops through them.
        
    3.  **Prepare Content:** For each contact, a card draft is generated or retrieved. An AI agent could personalize the message and artwork (future). If a fallback is needed, the default template and message are used.
        
    4.  **Delivery:** The `send-card` edge function sends the card via email, logs the result and returns success/failure to the scheduler. Additional channels (SMS via Twilio, Slack/Teams) can be supported by specialized functions.
        
    5.  **Notifications:** The recipient receives the card; the sender gets a confirmation. Failures are logged and surfaced to the user via notifications.
        
    
    ### 2.5 AI Personalization & Agentic Orchestration (Future)
    
    When multi‑agent orchestration is introduced, personalization becomes a collaborative process:
    
    1.  **Creative Brief Generation:** A Creative Director agent examines occasion and aura, producing a brief that guides style, tone and imagery.
        
    2.  **Content Writing:** A Content Writer agent uses the brief, contact context and relationship data to draft the card message.
        
    3.  **Image Creation:** An Image Artist agent generates artwork matching the brief; fallback images are selected if AI fails.
        
    4.  **Relationship Analysis:** A Relationship Analyst agent assesses the relationship to fine‑tune tone and gift recommendations.
        
    5.  **Delivery Coordination:** A Delivery Coordinator agent determines optimal send time and channel based on preferences and analytics.
        
    6.  **Quality Control:** A Quality Controller agent reviews content for appropriateness and alignment with branding.
        
    7.  **Orchestration Loop:** The Orchestrator coordinates these agents, handling retries, fallbacks and final assembly before sending.
        
    
    ### 2.6 Payment & Subscription Flow (Future)
    
    1.  **Plan Selection:** User navigates to pricing page and chooses a premium plan or one‑time arcade purchase.
        
    2.  **Checkout Creation:** The frontend calls `create-checkout` edge function, passing the user ID and selected plan. The function creates a Stripe Checkout Session and returns the URL.
        
    3.  **Redirect & Payment:** User is redirected to Stripe’s hosted checkout. After successful payment, Stripe redirects to `/payment-success` with a session ID.
        
    4.  **Webhook Handling:** A Stripe webhook triggers an edge function that verifies the event and updates the user’s subscription status in the database.
        
    5.  **Access Management:** Premium features become available to the user; the UI reflects the upgraded plan.
        
    
    ### 2.7 B2B Organization Flow (Future)
    
    1.  **Organization Creation:** A user upgrades to a business plan and creates an organization; the `organizations` table stores org data and `organization_members` links users to orgs.
        
    2.  **Team Management:** Admins invite team members and manage roles. Contacts can now belong to the organization rather than individuals; RLS policies allow org admins to access relevant data.
        
    3.  **Branded Card Design:** Admins set up default templates and corporate branding guidelines; Creative Director agent ensures brand consistency across all cards.
        
    4.  **Employee Celebrations:** Automation runs across the entire organization, sending cards/gifts to employees via email or Slack/Teams. Analytics dashboards track engagement and participation.
        
    
    3\. Data Model Overview
    -----------------------
    
    The following tables constitute the core data model (fields simplified):
    
    | Table | Key Fields | Purpose |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | users | id (UUID), email, name, aura_type, subscription_status | Stores user credentials, profile and subscription info |
    | contacts | id (UUID), user_id, name, email, birthday, relationship, aura_type, auto_send_enabled, tier | Holds contacts imported by each user |
    | cards | id, user_id, contact_id, template_id, message, image_url, status, scheduled_at, sent_at | Stores card drafts, scheduled and sent cards |
    | aura_quiz_responses | id, user_id, responses, aura_type, created_at | Records quiz answers and results |
    | gift_recommendations | id, aura_type, title, description, image_url, link | Static list of gift suggestions |
    | deliveries | id, card_id, channel, sent_at, status | Logs deliveries of cards via email/SMS/etc. |
    | Future: organizations, organization_members, automations, agent_logs | For B2B features, scheduling rules and agent orchestration logs. |  |
    
    4\. Integration Points & External Services
    ------------------------------------------
    
    *   **Google People API** – Fetches user contacts after OAuth; requires client ID/secret and People API enabled.
        
    *   **AI Image Services** – DALL‑E API, Stable Diffusion (AUTOMATIC1111 or SDXL) or other third‑party image models. Must support fallback to placeholder images.
        
    *   **Email Service** – Resend or SendGrid used by `send-card` edge function to deliver cards. Requires domain configuration for deliverability.
        
    *   **Stripe** – Handles payments and subscription billing; integrated via `create-checkout` function and webhooks.
        
    *   **Twilio** (Future) – For SMS delivery; integrate using Supabase functions.
        
    *   **Slack/Microsoft Teams** (Future) – Use webhooks or OAuth to post birthday messages in company channels.
        
    
    5\. Security Considerations
    ---------------------------
    
    *   **Row‑Level Security (RLS).** Every table must implement RLS to ensure users only access their own data. For organizations, policies must allow org members to access their org data.
        
    *   **OAuth Security.** Google import flows must protect client secrets; tokens should be stored securely and revoked when user revokes access.
        
    *   **API Keys.** AI and email service keys must be stored as environment variables and never exposed to the frontend. Edge functions should handle secrets.
        
    *   **Data Privacy.** Provide transparency on how personal data (contacts, birthdays, aura types) is used. Offer data export and deletion on demand.

Each prompt includes context and emphasises best practices like Supabase use, fallback strategies, and safety. Download here:
    
    BirthdayGen Prompt Playbook
    ===========================
    
    This playbook provides ready‑made prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI development agents to execute specific tasks during BirthdayGen’s development. The prompts are grouped by topic and align with the tasks in the project roadmap.
    
    1\. General Guidelines for Prompting
    ------------------------------------
    
    *   **Context:** Always include relevant context (file paths, existing functions, UI frameworks) in the prompt. For example, specify that the project uses React + Vite with TypeScript and the shadcn/ui component library.
        
    *   **Supabase:** Emphasize that backend operations should use Supabase’s JavaScript client and Row‑Level Security policies. Avoid hard‑coding secrets; edge functions handle privileged operations.
        
    *   **Design:** Remind the AI to maintain the magical, vibrant aesthetic, mobile responsiveness and accessibility guidelines.
        
    *   **AI Fallbacks:** When requesting AI integration, instruct the model to implement fallback logic (e.g., use local Stable Diffusion first, then OpenAI DALL‑E, then a static image).
        
    *   **Modularity:** Encourage reusable components and clean separation of concerns. Use hooks for data fetching and context where appropriate.
        
    *   **Safety:** Do not expose API keys; handle them in edge functions. Use try/catch around asynchronous calls and provide user‑friendly error messages.
        
    
    2\. UI & Frontend Prompts
    -------------------------
    
    ### 2.1 Simple Card Editor
    
    > **Prompt:** “Create a React component at `src/app/generator/simple/page.tsx`. Use Flexbox to build a two‑column layout: a control panel on the left and a live preview on the right. Include a `Textarea` for the message, a color picker for the background and a dropdown to select fonts (Serif, Sans‑serif, Monospace). Manage state with the `useState` hook and update the preview as the user types.”
    
    ### 2.2 Save & Send Buttons
    
    > **Prompt:** “Add a ‘Save Card’ button to the editor component. On click, send a POST request to `/api/cards` with the current card data (`message`, `backgroundColor`, `fontStyle`). Show a toast confirming success or displaying an error message.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “After saving a card, implement a ‘Send Card’ button that opens a dialog. Use a `Dialog` component from shadcn/ui. The dialog should include an `Input` for recipient email and a `Send` button. When clicked, send a POST request to `/api/cards/[cardId]/send` with the recipient email.”
    
    ### 2.3 Contacts Page
    
    > **Prompt:** “Modify `src/app/contacts/page.tsx` to fetch the user’s contacts from `/api/contacts` on page load using `useEffect`. Render a list of contacts with their names and birthdays. If there are no contacts, display a call‑to‑action to import or add new contacts.”
    
    ### 2.4 Navigation
    
    > **Prompt:** “Update `src/components/Navigation.tsx` to point the ‘Generator’ menu item to the new simple editor (`/generator/simple`).”
    
    3\. Supabase & Backend Prompts
    ------------------------------
    
    ### 3.1 Save Card Endpoint
    
    > **Prompt:** “Create a file `src/app/api/cards/route.ts`. Export an async `POST` function that retrieves the current user’s session via Supabase’s auth helper, parses `message`, `backgroundColor` and `fontStyle` from the request body, inserts a new row into the `cards` table via Prisma (assume a `Card` model exists) and returns the new card in JSON with a 201 status code.”
    
    ### 3.2 Send Card Endpoint
    
    > **Prompt:** “Create `src/app/api/cards/[cardId]/send/route.ts` as a POST handler. Use the `cardId` from the URL to retrieve the card from the database. Parse the recipient’s email from the request body. Call the `send-card` Supabase edge function with the card content and recipient email, await the response, then return a JSON success message.”
    
    ### 3.3 Contacts Endpoints
    
    > **Prompt:** “Implement `src/app/api/contacts/route.ts` for the GET method. Retrieve the current user’s ID from the Supabase session. Query the database for all contacts where `userId` matches and return them as JSON.”
    
    ### 3.4 Google OAuth Callback
    
    > **Prompt:** “In `src/app/api/import/callback/google/route.ts`, handle the People API OAuth callback. Use the `google-auth-library` to exchange the authorization code for an access token. Then call the People API (`people.connections.list`) to fetch the user’s contacts with names and birthdays. For each contact, insert a row into the `contacts` table with `userId` equal to the current user and the extracted data.”
    
    ### 3.5 Scheduled Automation Function
    
    > **Prompt:** “Write a Supabase edge function `send-due-cards` that runs daily. Query the database for contacts whose birthday matches today (based on month and day) and where `auto_send_enabled = true`. For each contact, retrieve or generate a card and call the existing `send-card` function. Record the result in a `deliveries` table to prevent duplicate sends. Handle errors gracefully.”
    
    4\. AI & Personalization Prompts
    --------------------------------
    
    ### 4.1 AI Image Generation
    
    > **Prompt:** “Update the `generate-ai-image` edge function to implement a fallback strategy: first call the local Stable Diffusion (SDXL or AUTOMATIC1111) with the prompt derived from the user’s aura and card theme; if it fails or times out, call OpenAI’s DALL‑E API; if that also fails, return a predefined static image URL.”
    
    ### 4.2 Dynamic Message Suggestions
    
    > **Prompt:** “Create an edge function `generate-card-message`. Input: sender name, recipient name, relationship, aura type, and optional fun fact. Use GPT‑4 to produce a 2‑3 sentence heartfelt birthday message matching the tone to the aura. Return the generated text along with a few alternative suggestions.”
    
    ### 4.3 Card Preview Bug
    
    > **Prompt:** “Investigate the card preview overlay bug. Refactor the preview component to layer the background image and text using absolute positioned `<div>` elements instead of drawing both on a canvas. Ensure the text scales correctly and updates instantly when the user changes it.”
    
    5\. Automation & Scheduling Prompts
    -----------------------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Add fields `auto_send_enabled` (boolean) and `tier` (enum: ‘message’, ‘card’, ‘card+gift’) to the `contacts` table via a Supabase migration. Update the contact form UI to include a toggle and tier dropdown. When enabled, these settings are saved with the contact.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “In the daily automation job, fetch contacts with birthdays today and auto‑send enabled. For each contact, decide the channel (currently email) and tier. If tier includes gift, append a gift suggestion from `gift_recommendations`.”
    
    6\. B2B & CRM Prompts
    ---------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Design a database schema for organizations: tables `organizations (id, name, logoUrl)` and `organization_members (orgId, userId, role)`. Write SQL and RLS policies allowing org members to access their org’s contacts.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Implement an admin dashboard for organizations using React. Fetch all employee contacts for the current organization and display upcoming birthdays, along with options to customize default templates and messages.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Create a Slack integration edge function that posts a birthday message to a Slack channel via an incoming webhook. Input: channel webhook URL, card content. Use fetch to POST the message as JSON. Handle and log non‑200 responses.”
    
    7\. Multi‑Agent Orchestration Prompts
    -------------------------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Define agent roles and initial prompts for a multi‑agent system: Creative Director (sets style guide), Content Writer (drafts message), Image Artist (generates artwork), Relationship Analyst (provides relationship context), Delivery Coordinator (chooses channel/time), and Quality Controller (reviews output). Provide a structure for passing data between agents.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Implement an orchestration function that sequentially calls each agent with the necessary context, collects their outputs and assembles the final card. Use retries and fallbacks if any agent fails or flags an issue.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Develop evaluation metrics for generated content: approval rate, originality score and appropriateness. Log agent outputs and user edits to refine prompts over time.”
    
    8\. Testing & Performance Prompts
    ---------------------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Write Jest unit tests for the function that calculates upcoming birthdays. Test edge cases such as leap years and different time zones. Ensure the function returns events sorted chronologically.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Use React Testing Library to simulate user interactions with the new card editor: entering text, changing colors, saving and sending a card. Verify that state updates and API calls are made correctly.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Profile the card preview component using Chrome DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize by memoizing expensive operations and leveraging requestAnimationFrame for animations.”
    
    9\. Marketing & Affiliate Integration Prompts
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Create a referral code system. Design a `referrals` table with `code`, `referredBy`, `referredUserId` and `createdAt` fields. Implement logic to generate unique codes for affiliate partners and record signups using those codes.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Write a function `attachAffiliateLink(url, vendor)` that appends the correct affiliate tracking parameters for Amazon or Etsy to a product URL. Use this when rendering gift suggestion links.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Add a lead capture form on the marketing site for corporate prospects. On submission, store the lead in a `leads` table and send a notification email to the sales team.”
    
    10\. Gamification & Engagement Prompts
    --------------------------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Optimize the existing Emoji Match and Memory games for mobile. Adjust the canvas size based on the viewport, use touch events for input and ensure animations run smoothly on 60 fps.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Implement a login streak tracker. On each user login, compare the last active date with today; if consecutive, increment `streakCount`, else reset to 1. Store `streakCount` and `lastActive` on the `users` table. Display the current streak on the dashboard.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Design a simple reward system: after a 7‑day streak, unlock a new premium template; after a 30‑day streak, grant a badge. Implement these as conditions when updating streaks and reflect unlocks in the UI.”
    
    11\. Content & Gift Recommendations Prompts
    -------------------------------------------
    
    > **Prompt:** “Populate the `gift_recommendations` table with 3 gift ideas for each aura type. Include fields: `title`, `description`, `imageUrl` and `affiliateLink`. Write SQL or JavaScript insertion scripts accordingly.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Implement a `GiftSuggestions` component that fetches gifts based on a contact’s aura. Render cards with images, descriptions and ‘Buy’ buttons linking to the affiliate URL.”
    
    > **Prompt:** “Write a GPT‑4 prompt that, given an aura type and one or two user interests, returns three creative gift ideas along with a short description for each.”
    
    * * *
    
    By following these prompts, LLM developers and AI agents can systematically build out BirthdayGen’s features with clear instructions and consistent quality. The playbook is intended as a living resource; as new tasks and agents emerge, additional prompts should be added.
    

These documents together form a comprehensive blueprint for completing the BirthdayGen MVP and guiding future enhancements. Feel free to review them and let me know if any refinements or additional sections are needed.

How could I have written my prompt(s) better to get all the information necessary to take a handoff mid-project and deliver a foolproof documentation and execution strategy I can deliver to agent(s), LLM(s) etc to carry out execution of the rest of the project covering all aspects of a project that is inherently involved including the complexity and contextual memory needed. Apply that prompt to this project please as well.

## ChatGPT
You asked for feedback on how your prompts could more effectively elicit all of the information needed for a seamless mid‑project handoff, and to apply that improved approach to the BirthdayGen project. The key to getting a “foolproof” execution plan from an AI lies in clear scoping, precise instructions about what data to collect and where to find it, explicit deliverable formats, and a realistic timeline. Below is an analysis of how to strengthen your prompts, followed by an improved example tailored for BirthdayGen.

* * *

1\. Suggestions to Improve Your Prompts
---------------------------------------

1.  **Provide Context and Objectives**  
    Begin by stating the current stage of the project (e.g., “mid‑development” or “post‑MVP”) and the goal of the handoff. Include the overarching mission or unique aspects of the product so the AI knows what to prioritize.
    
2.  **Specify Data Sources and Search Tasks**  
    If internal documents exist, name them explicitly and instruct the AI to retrieve and summarize them via the appropriate connectors (e.g. Google Drive). Also state whether the AI should perform a web search for recent updates or rely solely on internal resources. This prevents the AI from overlooking crucial files like gap analyses, current goals, or design briefs.
    
3.  **Define Deliverables and Format**  
    List the documents you expect (FRD, PFD, task list, prompt playbook, agent orchestration blueprint, directive, etc.) and specify their desired formats (e.g. Markdown files, tables for microtasks). Mention any citation requirements and whether attachments should be separately synced.
    
4.  **Set Scope and Depth**  
    Clarify whether the AI should cover only MVP features or also future enhancements like AI agent orchestration and enterprise CRM. Indicate the required level of detail (e.g., “include code snippets, Supabase policies, and microtask prompts”).
    
5.  **Include a Timeline and Milestones**  
    Give the AI a realistic deadline (e.g., three days) and ask it to break down the work into day‑by‑day tasks or sequential phases. This helps ensure that the execution plan is actionable within the timeframe.
    
6.  **Emphasize Validation and Fallback Strategies**  
    Instruct the AI to highlight critical risk areas (like OAuth, scheduled automation, or AI reliability) and propose validation steps or fallback options (e.g., default images if AI art fails). This builds resilience into the plan.
    
7.  **Ask for Agent Roles and Coordination**  
    If multiple LLM agents will be involved, request a description of each agent’s role (e.g., Creative Director, Content Writer, Image Artist) and how they will communicate and hand off work. Ask for a directive that those agents can follow autonomously.
    
8.  **Invite Updates and Assumptions**  
    Because mid‑project handoffs can be ambiguous, allow the AI to state any assumptions it makes and encourage it to ask clarifying questions only when critical information is missing.

Use the Google Drive connector via API Tool to search for and download any missing files (e.g. `bdaygenrewrite.md` or `CURRENT_GOALS.md`) and summarize them.  
Use the public web to verify any “latest” information only if needed; otherwise prioritize internal sources.

### Required Deliverables
Produce the following, each as a separate Markdown document:
1. **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)** – Summarize the product scope, user requirements, and MVP vs. future features.  
2. **Process & Architecture Document (PFD)** – Describe the technical architecture, major process flows (onboarding, card creation, automation), data model and integration points.  
3. **Comprehensive Task List** – Break the remaining work into granular tasks and microtasks with status indicators and priorities.  Include code‑level tasks (e.g., finish Google OAuth, implement AI fallback logic), database migrations, UI fixes and test scenarios.  
4. **Prompt Playbook** – Provide ready‑to‑use prompts for each microtask or agent role.  Prompts should instruct LLMs on writing React/Tailwind code, Supabase edge functions, RLS policies, Cron schedules, Stripe integration, etc.  
5. **Agent Orchestration Blueprint** – Outline the roles (Project Manager, Front‑End Developer, Back‑End Developer, AI Specialist, QA, etc.), their responsibilities, the sequence of tasks they should perform over the 3‑day period, and how they will hand off outputs to each other.  
6. **Agent Directive** – Write a directive that can be given to each agent explaining how to access the documentation, how to verify tasks, test their work, raise risks, and follow fallback strategies (e.g., if DALL‑E fails, use SDXL or a static image).

### Scope & Depth
- Cover all MVP features (registration/login, contact CRUD & import, card studio with AI art and preview, scheduling & automation, mini‑game arcade, basic reminders) and outline the next steps toward AI multi‑agent orchestration and enterprise CRM.  
- Include advanced tasks such as configuring OAuth credentials, replacing the local Stable Diffusion server with a cloud fallback, setting up Stripe checkout, and designing referral/affiliate systems.  
- For each feature, provide validation tests, required Supabase RLS policies, and error‑handling plans.

### Timeline & Milestones (3 days)
- **Day 1**: Fix environment and dependencies, finish Google OAuth import, build simple card editor & save API; generate FRD and PFD drafts for review.  
- **Day 2**: Implement email sending, scheduling function and AI fallback logic; polish the card preview; finalize task list and prompt playbook.  
- **Day 3**: Integrate basic gamification, prepare multi‑agent scaffolding, draft marketing/affiliate plan; deliver final agent blueprint and directive.  
Explain any assumptions or constraints you make, and call out risks (e.g., missing OAuth credentials or long image‑generation times) with mitigation strategies.

### Instructions
- Use API Tool to search Google Drive for the named files, fetch them, and summarize their contents.  
- Where internal sources are ambiguous or outdated, perform a web search to find current best practices (e.g., latest Resend/Twilio APIs).  
- When presenting tasks, use tables only for short entries; keep narrative explanations in prose.  
- Provide in‑text citations referencing the original documents (FRD, PFD, etc.) as footnotes for traceability (example: ).  
- Deliver each requested document via `computer.sync_file`, and include the file IDs in your response.  

Please begin immediately and let me know if any critical information is missing before proceeding.

    Day‑by‑Day Plan
    ---------------
    
    ### Day 1: Foundation & Contact Management
    
    **PM**
    
    *   Review existing FRD, PFD, gap analysis, current goals and feature lists. Identify any missing information from Google Drive (e.g., `bdaygenrewrite.md`, `CURRENT_GOALS.md`) and instruct AI agents to fetch them via the Google Drive connector. Update the comprehensive task list accordingly.
        
    *   Create a shared Kanban board or update the provided task list to track micro‑tasks and status. Assign tasks to roles.
        
    *   Ensure that required API keys (Supabase, Resend, AI services) and OAuth credentials are available or note them as blockers.
        
    
    **FE**
    
    *   Fix build system inconsistencies (migrate fully to Vite by removing CRA remnants). Confirm that `npm run dev` starts without errors.
        
    *   Implement the **simple card editor** page: create a two‑column layout, controlled inputs for message, background color and font family, and a live preview using React state. Use shadcn/ui components for form controls.
        
    *   Develop **contact CRUD** UI (list, add, edit, delete). Use Formik/React‑Hook‑Form for validation and Supabase JS client for database operations.
        
    *   Wire up **CSV import** of contacts: parse uploaded CSV and insert rows into the `contacts` table. Provide feedback on success/failure.
        
    
    **BE**
    
    *   Define or update Supabase tables: `users`, `contacts`, `cards`, `aura_quiz_responses`, `gift_recommendations`, and `deliveries`. Add fields for `auto_send_enabled` and `tier`. Write row‑level security policies so users can only access their data.
        
    *   Develop a **Save Card** API route (`cards` edge function) that accepts card data (message, background color, font) and stores it with `status='draft'`. Return the new card record.
        
    *   Begin implementing **Google OAuth integration** for contact import: configure OAuth credentials in Supabase Auth, create an edge function to exchange auth codes for People API tokens, and return contact data for insertion. Note that actual credentials may require user action.
        
    
    **AI**
    
    *   Evaluate AI image services: DALL‑E 3 (preferred), SDXL (fallback via a free provider), and a basic static fallback. Draft prompts for each aura type (e.g., “A {aura}‑themed birthday card illustration with cosmic sparkles”).
        
    *   Start building the `generate-ai-image` function: accept parameters like aura and occasion, call the primary AI service, and implement a fallback chain if the first call fails.
        
    *   Prepare basic prompt templates for future multi‑agent roles (Creative Director, Content Writer, etc.) but focus on MVP features.
        
    
    **QA**
    
    *   Write unit tests for contact form validation and card saving. Create a test plan covering registration, login, contact CRUD and card editor.
        
    *   Review accessibility of UI components (labels, contrast) and responsive behavior on mobile.
        
    
    **DevOps**
    
    *   Set up environment variables for Supabase URL/anon key, email service API key, AI API keys and OAuth client IDs.
        
    *   Deploy the current code to a staging environment (Netlify/Vercel). Verify that environment variables are properly loaded and the build succeeds.
        
    *   Configure DNS records and domain verification for the email service (Resend or SendGrid) to improve deliverability.
        
    
    ### Day 2: Automation, Delivery & AI Integration
    
    **PM**
    
    *   Review Day 1 progress and unblock any tasks. Confirm that Google OAuth configuration is ready; if not, schedule user takeover.
        
    *   Finalize acceptance criteria for MVP features: user registration, contact import, card creation and send, scheduling and reminders.
        
    *   Assign tasks for Day 2 and ensure agents understand dependencies (e.g., email send relies on the `send-card` function and domain configuration).
        
    
    **FE**
    
    *   Add UI controls to enable **auto‑send** per contact: a toggle and tier selector (message only, card, card + gift). Save these settings to the database.
        
    *   Implement **scheduled send** UI: allow selecting a future date/time for each card and send the data to the backend.
        
    *   Integrate **email send** button for immediate sending: call the `send-card` function and provide a confirmation/toast on success.
        
    *   Polish the card preview: fix text overlay issues by layering HTML elements instead of using canvas; ensure WYSIWYG matches the final output.
        
    
    **BE**
    
    *   Implement the **`send-card`** edge function: retrieve card data, call the email service (Resend), embed the card image and text into an email template, send the email, log the result in `deliveries`, and ensure idempotency.
        
    *   Build the **automation scheduler** (`send-due-cards`): schedule this function via Supabase cron (or external cron) to run daily. It queries contacts with birthdays today and `auto_send_enabled=true`, composes cards (generating AI images if needed) and calls `send-card`. Mark cards as sent to avoid duplicates.
        
    *   Complete **Google OAuth callback** and contact import functions. Map People API data to our schema and insert it into `contacts`. Handle duplicates gracefully.
        
    *   Write Supabase SQL functions or RPCs to find upcoming events and return them to the dashboard.
        
    
    **AI**
    
    *   Finish the `generate-ai-image` edge function: finalize fallback logic and upload generated images to Supabase Storage. Ensure content moderation (filter out NSFW results) and handle errors gracefully.
        
    *   Generate a few sample gift recommendations per aura type for static suggestions. Store them in `gift_recommendations`.
        
    *   Collaborate with FE to integrate AI image generation into the card editor (the “Remix” button). Provide clear loading states and error messages.
        
    
    **QA**
    
    *   Test the send flow: send a card to a test email and verify receipt. Check that images and text render correctly in various email clients.
        
    *   Validate the scheduler by setting a contact’s birthday to the current date and observing that a card is sent automatically.
        
    *   Perform security review of edge functions (no secret leakage, proper input validation, RLS enforcement).
        
    
    **DevOps**
    
    *   Set up a staging domain for outgoing emails and configure SPF/DKIM records. Monitor deliverability and resolve bounce issues.
        
    *   Deploy updated edge functions and schedule them. Use Supabase logs to monitor their execution and errors.
        
    *   If Stripe integration is feasible within the timeframe, scaffold the checkout function and webhook; otherwise document it for future work.
        
    
    ### Day 3: Polishing, Gamification & Agentic Prep
    
    **PM**
    
    *   Review all deliverables (FRD, PFD, task list, prompt playbook). Ensure tasks from gap analyses and current goals are addressed. Prepare a handoff summary for stakeholders.
        
    *   Coordinate final testing and bug fixes. Ensure all critical bugs are prioritized and resolved.
        
    *   Plan next‑step roadmap for post‑MVP features (multi‑agent orchestration, B2B, CRM) and include it in the documentation.
        
    
    **FE**
    
    *   Integrate **mini‑game arcade** (Emoji Match, Memory, Trivia, Catch Ball) into the app navigation. Ensure games load correctly, are mobile friendly, and do not block UI threads. Fix any canvas performance issues.
        
    *   Add user engagement features like streak count and reward placeholder text (actual rewards can be implemented later).
        
    *   Refine UI/UX: improve animations, tooltips, error messages and responsive design. Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, contrast).
        
    
    **BE**
    
    *   Prepare the database for future B2B and agentic features: create placeholder tables (`organizations`, `organization_members`, `automations`, `agent_logs`) with basic fields. Add RLS policies but leave them unused for now.
        
    *   Develop a simple **analysis API** that returns metrics for the dashboard (e.g., number of contacts imported, cards sent, upcoming events). FE can display these metrics to show user progress.
        
    *   Document how to integrate **Twilio** for SMS and Slack/Teams for notifications; stub out functions and leave TODOs.
        
    
    **AI**
    
    *   Draft a **multi‑agent orchestration plan**: define prompt templates and message flow for the Creative Director, Content Writer, Image Artist, Relationship Analyst, Delivery Coordinator and Quality Controller. This should live in the prompt playbook.
        
    *   Create fallback guidelines for each agent (e.g., if image generation fails, use default backgrounds; if text generation fails, use template messages).
        
    *   Suggest improvements to the aura quiz questions and AI personalization based on user feedback.
        
    
    **QA**
    
    *   Perform regression testing across all flows (onboarding, card creation, scheduling, sending, arcade). Verify that earlier bug fixes remain intact.
        
    *   Conduct cross‑browser and responsive tests. Run Lighthouse or similar to measure performance and accessibility scores.
        
    *   Compile a test report highlighting any open issues and recommendations for future improvements.
        
    
    **DevOps**
    
    *   Finalize deployment of the latest build. Tag the release (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta`) and update documentation for environment setup.
        
    *   Monitor logs and analytics; ensure scheduled jobs run as expected. Set up alerts for failures in automation or send functions.
        
    *   Document the deployment process and environment variables in the project wiki or README.
        
    
    Completion Criteria
    -------------------
    
    *   **Feature completeness:** User sign‑up/login, contact management (CRUD & import), aura quiz, card studio with AI image generation and preview, card saving/scheduling, send via email, automation rules and scheduler, mini‑game arcade entry, and basic user dashboard.
        
    *   **Reliability:** Email send success rate ≥ 99 %, AI generation fallback functional, scheduler triggers cards on time, and UI responsive on mobile and desktop.
        
    *   **Documentation:** Updated FRD, PFD, comprehensive task list, prompt playbook, agent blueprint and agent directive delivered as separate files with citations. Comments and TODOs in the codebase for future work.
        
    
    Meeting these criteria signals that the MVP is ready for limited beta release and that the team is prepared to move into post‑MVP enhancements.
    
*   **Agent Directive** – provides step‑by‑step guidance for each agent role, including how to use existing documentation, interact with Supabase and Google Drive connectors, implement and test features, enforce RLS and security, coordinate hand‑offs, and adhere to quality and validation standards. It also captures assumptions, clarifications, and overall workflow. Access it here:
    
    BirthdayGen Agent Directive
    ===========================
    
    Purpose & Scope
    ---------------
    
    This directive is intended for all agents (LLMs or human collaborators) working on the BirthdayGen project during the three‑day sprint. It describes how to use the provided documentation, where to find additional information, and how to execute tasks efficiently and safely. The goal is to deliver a fully functioning MVP while laying foundations for future enhancements such as multi‑agent orchestration, B2B features and advanced AI personalization.
    
    Available Resources
    -------------------
    
    You have access to several documents and tools. Always review these before starting a task:
    
    1.  **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)** – Defines all MVP and future features, user stories, non‑functional requirements and assumptions. Refer to it when clarifying what the system should do.
        
    2.  **Process & Architecture Document (PFD)** – Explains the overall architecture (React + Supabase), major process flows (onboarding, card creation, automation), data model, integration points and security considerations. Use it to understand how components interact and where your work fits.
        
    3.  **Comprehensive Task List** – Breaks down work into granular tasks and micro‑tasks with status indicators and acceptance criteria. Update this list as tasks are completed or new tasks arise.
        
    4.  **Prompt Playbook** – Contains ready‑to‑use prompts for coding tasks, API development, AI integration, testing and agent roles. Follow these prompts when requesting LLM assistance or delegating to other agents.
        
    5.  **Agent Blueprint** – Defines the schedule and responsibilities for each role across three days (see “BirthdayGen Agent Orchestration Blueprint”). Follow the timeline and coordinate hand‑offs accordingly.
        
    6.  **Gap Analysis, Feature List, Future State & Current Goals** – Provide additional context on what’s missing, planned enhancements, and near‑term objectives. Check these documents for tasks not covered elsewhere.
        
    7.  **Google Drive Connector** – Use the API Tool to search for and retrieve any additional project documents. When searching, use concise keywords (e.g., `birthdaygen goals` or `user onboarding`) and adjust query terms if initial searches fail. Always prefer internal documents over public sources when available.
        
    
    General Guidelines
    ------------------
    
    1.  **Research & Information Gathering**
        
        *   Before starting a task, read the relevant sections of the FRD and PFD to understand requirements and architecture. If information is missing, search Google Drive for additional files.
            
        *   Use the **`Google Drive_search`** API for simple keyword searches and **`Google Drive_fetch`** to download files. Avoid broad or natural language queries; search tokens are combined with AND logic.
            
        *   If you need up‑to‑date best practices (e.g., for configuring DALL‑E API or email domain setup), use the web browser to search reputable sources. Cite all sources.
            
    2.  **Coding & Implementation**
        
        *   Use the existing codebase as a starting point. Maintain consistency with the tech stack: React + Vite for frontend, shadcn/ui for components, Supabase JS client for database interactions, and Supabase Edge Functions for backend logic.
            
        *   When modifying code, provide the **entire file** or function in your patch, not just the changes. This helps ensure reproducibility.
            
        *   Always implement and test Row Level Security (RLS) policies when creating or updating tables. Users must only access their own data.
            
        *   Secure secrets: never expose API keys, OAuth credentials or tokens in frontend code. Place them in environment variables and access them within edge functions.
            
        *   Provide fallback logic: if AI image generation fails, use a default image; if email sending fails, retry or log an error; if OAuth credentials are missing, signal the PM for takeover.
            
    3.  **Testing & Validation**
        
        *   Write unit and integration tests for each feature. Use Jest for pure functions and consider Cypress or Playwright for E2E flows. QA agents must verify UI interactions, API responses, and security policies.
            
        *   Validate accessibility (WCAG‑AA), responsiveness and performance. Use tools like Lighthouse, axe and manual checks.
            
        *   When developing AI prompts, validate outputs for appropriateness and alignment with the brand. Use moderation APIs if necessary.
            
    4.  **Collaboration & Communication**
        
        *   The **Project Manager** coordinates tasks. FE, BE, AI, QA and DevOps agents should report progress and blockers daily. Use the task list to update status (e.g., ✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, ⏳ Not Started).
            
        *   Hand off outputs clearly: when a function or component is ready, document its usage and integrate it into the main branch via pull request. Include test cases and update the blueprint or directive if required.
            
        *   Document assumptions, limitations and TODOs. If you encounter missing credentials or external dependencies, flag them immediately for user intervention.
            
    5.  **Role‑Specific Directives**
        
    
    ### Project Manager (PM)
    
    *   Maintain the master task list and ensure that all tasks follow the blueprint timeline. Update statuses as tasks complete or change scope.
        
    *   Fetch any missing documents via Google Drive search. Summarize and share them with the team.
        
    *   Monitor dependencies: e.g., ensure Supabase tables exist before FE builds forms; ensure OAuth credentials are configured before contact import tasks.
        
    *   Track risk areas (e.g., AI service limits, email deliverability) and coordinate mitigation strategies.
        
    *   Prepare end‑of‑day summaries and final handoff notes at the end of Day 3.
        
    
    ### Frontend Developer (FE)
    
    *   Follow the PFD when implementing UI flows: onboarding, contact import, card editor, automation, arcade. Use shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
        
    *   Keep UI state consistent with Supabase (e.g., update contact list on insert/delete). Handle optimistic updates carefully and roll back on errors.
        
    *   Ensure real‑time preview reflects user inputs for cards. Use HTML layering instead of canvas for text overlay to avoid layout bugs.
        
    *   Test on multiple screen sizes and browsers. Provide accessible markup (labels, aria‑attributes) and ensure keyboard navigability.
        
    *   Document how to extend components for future B2B or multi‑agent features.
        
    
    ### Backend Developer (BE)
    
    *   Write and deploy edge functions for saving cards, sending cards, generating AI images, importing contacts and scheduling automation. Use the Supabase CLI to test locally.
        
    *   Ensure idempotency and logging in all functions: a card should not be sent twice, and errors should produce meaningful logs.
        
    *   Create tables and RLS policies as specified in the blueprint. Use foreign keys for relational integrity and triggers or functions where necessary (e.g., to calculate next birthday).
        
    *   Coordinate with DevOps to schedule cron jobs and with AI to implement fallback logic.
        
    *   Prepare hooks for future features (B2B, multi‑agent) by defining placeholder tables and RPCs.
        
    
    ### AI Specialist (AI)
    
    *   Design robust prompts for AI image generation and text personalization. Include aura type, occasion, relationship and style guide. Keep prompts concise but descriptive.
        
    *   Implement fallback chains: if DALL‑E or your primary model fails or returns inappropriate content, call a secondary model (e.g., SDXL) and finally fall back to a static image.
        
    *   Provide the **Prompt Playbook** with examples for each agent role: Creative Director (style brief), Content Writer (message drafting), Image Artist (art style), Relationship Analyst (tone & context), Delivery Coordinator (send schedule), and Quality Controller (QC feedback).
        
    *   Collaborate with BE to integrate AI calls into edge functions and with FE to show progress indicators and handle user actions (e.g., regenerate art).
        
    *   Evaluate AI output quality and safety. Use moderation endpoints when available.
        
    
    ### Quality Assurance (QA)
    
    *   Build and maintain a test suite covering all user journeys: registration, login, contact import, card creation, sending, scheduling, and arcade games.
        
    *   Perform manual and automated testing across devices, browsers and network conditions. Check for regressions after each deployment.
        
    *   Validate compliance with requirements from the FRD (functionality) and non‑functional requirements (performance under 500 ms response time, accessibility).
        
    *   Verify RLS policies by attempting unauthorized data access and ensuring it fails.
        
    *   Document test results and open issues. Coordinate with PM to prioritize and fix critical bugs.
        
    
    ### DevOps/Deployment (DevOps)
    
    *   Set up and manage deployment pipelines (Netlify/Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend). Define staging and production environments with separate credentials.
        
    *   Configure DNS and verify email domain for Resend/SendGrid. Ensure SPF/DKIM/DMARC records are correct to avoid spam filters.
        
    *   Manage environment variables and secrets. Provide a secure mechanism for storing API keys and OAuth credentials.
        
    *   Schedule cron jobs for the automation engine. Monitor logs and performance, set up alerts on failures or high latency.
        
    *   Assist with Stripe/Twilio integrations as needed.
        
    
    Quality & Validation Standards
    ------------------------------
    
    1.  **Feature Validation**: Each feature must satisfy the acceptance criteria listed in the task list. For example, contact import should handle duplicates gracefully and provide user feedback; the card editor should update previews in under 200 ms.
        
    2.  **Reliability**: Functions should handle errors gracefully (return useful messages, retry logic, fallback images). Automation must be idempotent and logged.
        
    3.  **Security**: Enforce RLS policies. Validate input on both client and server. Never expose secrets. Comply with GDPR/CCPA by allowing users to export and delete their data.
        
    4.  **Performance**: API calls should respond in <500 ms where possible. AI image generation is allowed up to 30 s; show progress indicators to users.
        
    5.  **Documentation & Citations**: All deliverables must include citations to the source documents using footnote format (e.g., ). When adding new sections to FRD, PFD or task lists, reference the original line numbers.
        
    
    Timeline & Workflow
    -------------------
    
    Follow the **Agent Blueprint** for a detailed daily schedule. In summary:
    
    *   **Day 1**: Fix environment, build contact management and card editor, configure database & policies, start AI setup, deploy a basic site.
        
    *   **Day 2**: Implement send and scheduling functions, finalize AI image generation, complete Google contact import, polish preview and auto‑send UI.
        
    *   **Day 3**: Integrate mini‑games, refine UX/accessibility, prepare multi‑agent scaffolding, and produce final documentation (FRD, PFD, task list, prompt playbook, blueprint and directive).
        
    
    Finish each day by updating the task list, committing code changes, and summarizing progress to the PM. The PM compiles end‑of‑day reports and ensures readiness for the next day’s tasks.
    
    Assumptions & Clarifications
    ----------------------------
    
    *   Supabase is the primary backend platform; no separate server is used. All server‑side logic runs via edge functions.
        
    *   AI services (OpenAI, DALL‑E, SDXL) may require API keys and could incur costs; choose the cost‑efficient model that meets quality requirements. For MVP, static fallback images are acceptable.
        
    *   Google OAuth credentials must be configured by the user; if unavailable, note this as a blocker.
        
    *   If a critical detail is missing and cannot be safely assumed, ask the PM or user for clarification instead of guessing. Otherwise, proceed with reasonable assumptions and document them.
        
    
    By following this directive, agents will be able to work autonomously yet cohesively, ensuring that the BirthdayGen project reaches a complete and stable MVP on schedule.
    

These documents should allow your team or autonomous agents to complete the BirthdayGen MVP within the three‑day timeline and prepare for future enhancements. Let me know if you need any updates or additional documents.

Here is a detailed assessment of **free / open‑source tools** and how they can be combined with your existing tech stack to implement the BirthdayGen agent‑orchestration process with minimal manual oversight. The goal is to enable long‑running, automated execution of your feature roadmap so that you can “set it and walk away” for hours and still make progress.

### 1\. Workflow Automation & Orchestration Platforms

| Platform | What it Provides | Why It Fits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n8n (self‑hosted) | An open‑source workflow automation platform that lets you drag‑and‑drop multi‑step flows while also allowing custom code. It emphasises AI integration and can host agents on‑prem or in the cloud. The product page notes that n8n gives technical teams the freedom to build with code or no‑code, and that it “gives you more freedom to implement multi‑step AI agents and integrate apps than any other tooln8n.io”. It also highlights that you can self‑host everything, including AI models, deploy with Docker and access the entire source coden8n.io. | Use n8n as your central automation hub. You can build workflows that trigger when new contacts are added, call AI models (through HTTP nodes), save data to Supabase, schedule card‑delivery jobs, and send emails or Slack messages. Its self‑host capability means you keep full control over data and avoid vendor lock‑in. n8n’s “drag‑n‑drop” UI plus code nodes lets you embed Python or JavaScript when needed, while still allowing the platform to run unattended. |
| CrewAI | A free, open‑source multi‑agent framework designed for production systems. It emphasizes role‑playing agents collaborating on tasks and is independent of LangChainfirecrawl.dev. CrewAI is easy to implement but currently lacks streaming function calling. | Use CrewAI to structure your creative agent team (e.g., Creative Director, Content Writer, Image Artist, QA). Each agent can be defined with its own LLM prompt and tool access. Because CrewAI is simple to set up and open source, you can run it locally alongside your Supabase backend and call it from n8n. |
| Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) | An open‑source SDK from Azure AI combining Semantic Kernel’s enterprise foundations with AutoGen’s orchestrationdevblogs.microsoft.com. It offers open standards (MCP/A2A/OpenAPI) and dynamic orchestration patterns such as sequential, concurrent, group chat and handoffdevblogs.microsoft.com, and it comes with pluggable memory stores and built‑in observability and approvalsdevblogs.microsoft.com. The project is “100% open source”devblogs.microsoft.com. | MAF is well‑suited if you want enterprise‑grade orchestration with auditing and compliance. It can manage complex multi‑agent workflows (e.g., call the AI image generator, then call Qwen3‑Coder for code fixes, then call a QA agent) and plug into vector stores for memory. Integrate it into your back‑end microservices and call it via n8n or your own HTTP endpoints. |
| AutoGen | A multi‑agent conversation framework from Microsoft Research. It offers event‑driven architecture and scalable workflowsfirecrawl.dev. AutoGen is free and open source. | Useful for experimenting with AI agent dialogue flows. You can create custom agents that discuss and decide on tasks (e.g., brainstorming card text, summarising contact information). AutoGen works well for prototypes and research; you may transition to MAF or CrewAI for production. |
| LangGraph | A stateful agent‑orchestration library that supports long‑term memory, streaming and hierarchical flows; enterprises like Klarna use it for complex customer supportfirecrawl.dev. | If you need to build stateful, hierarchical workflows, LangGraph can manage them. However, it is tied to LangChain (for now) and might introduce latency compared to CrewAIresearch.aimultiple.com. |
| AutoAgent (Skywork) | A zero‑code open‑source framework that lets you orchestrate teams of agents via natural language. It has an LLM‑powered actionable engine, self‑managing file system & agentic RAG, self‑play agent customisation, and a manager–worker coordination modelskywork.aiskywork.aiskywork.ai. | If you want to let non‑developers orchestrate agents, AutoAgent is compelling. A manager agent can assign tasks to a researcher, analyst and writer agent, and the system automatically stores files and improves prompts. You could integrate AutoAgent with your stack to handle marketing copy or blog posts. |

### 2\. Event & Task Automation Tools

| Tool | Why It Fits |
| --- | --- |
| Huginn | A Ruby‑based, self‑hosted automation tool that monitors events and triggers actions. It’s fully open source but has a steep learning curvegetmesa.com. Use it if you need to watch RSS feeds or calendars and trigger workflows when certain conditions occur. |
| StackStorm | An event‑driven automation platform for infrastructure and DevOps with high extensibilitygetmesa.com. It’s useful for infrastructure tasks (e.g., restarting the AI image server, updating containers) that you want to automate in the background. |
| Activepieces | A modern open‑source workflow builder with a user‑friendly UI and Apache‑2.0 licensegetmesa.com. It’s an alternative to n8n if you prefer a simpler interface and are comfortable with fewer integrations. |
| Node‑RED | A lightweight flow‑based tool designed for IoT. It can connect APIs and devices but has limited SaaS integrationsgetmesa.com. Use it if you need to tie local hardware (e.g., printing physical cards) into your process. |
| Apache Airflow | Robust for data‑oriented ETL pipelines and scheduled jobsgetmesa.com. Use it for long‑running data tasks like generating analytics for gift recommendations or email metrics. |

### 3\. Open‑Source AI Models & Libraries

| Model / Library | Key Attributes | Why It Fits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3‑Coder | A 480‑Billion‑parameter Mixture‑of‑Experts code model from Alibaba Cloud. It uses 35B active parameters and achieves state‑of‑the‑art results on agentic coding and browser‑use tasks, while supporting a long context window up to 256K tokens (extendable to 1M)github.comgithub.com. It covers 358 programming languagesgithub.com. | Use Qwen3‑Coder as your coding agent to generate and refactor TypeScript/React components, Supabase functions, or automation scripts. Its long context means it can read large files (like your FRD or PFD) and reason over them. Deploy it locally via a GPU server or call it through open‑source inference services. |
| DeepSeek‑V3.1 | An open‑source model offering hybrid inference with “Think” and “Non‑Think” modes for faster execution and stronger agent skillsapi-docs.deepseek.com. It supports a 128K context, strict function calling, and has post‑training improvements for tool use and multi‑step tasksapi-docs.deepseek.com. Weights are available on Hugging Faceapi-docs.deepseek.com. | Use DeepSeek‑V3.1 for multi‑step reasoning tasks, such as generating personalised card messages based on contact data and aura quiz responses. The strict function calling makes it ideal for integration with tools (e.g., call a function to send an email only when certain conditions are met). |
| a‑mem (A‑Memorisation) | Likely refers to an open‑source memory cache for agents. Use it to persist conversation state and share context across multiple agents (e.g., storing aura quiz results and preferences). |  |
| Other Open Models | Models like HuggingFace’s Llama 3 derivatives or OpenAI whisper clones can run locally. Use them as fallback for tasks that do not require strong reasoning. |  |

### 4\. Integration with Existing Stack

1.  **Supabase** – Continue using Supabase as your backend. Store users, contacts, cards and automations. Use Supabase Edge Functions for secure server‑side operations (e.g., generating AI images, sending emails). Schedule jobs via Airflow or a cron service to trigger n8n flows that send reminders.
    
2.  **React/TypeScript Front‑end** – Maintain your Vite + React front‑end. Use Qwen3‑Coder or DeepSeek to auto‑generate components and fix bugs.
    
3.  **n8n as Orchestrator** –
    
    *   **Triggers**: n8n can watch Supabase events or time‑based triggers.
        
    *   **AI Calls**: Use HTTP nodes in n8n to call your self‑hosted Qwen3‑Coder or DeepSeek endpoints for message/image generation.
        
    *   **Multi‑Agent**: Create flows that call CrewAI or MAF endpoints for orchestrating creative agents.
        
    *   **Email/SMS**: Integrate with email APIs (e.g., Resend via Supabase) or Twilio for SMS.
        
    *   **Monitoring**: n8n’s UI lets you see the execution history and easily retry failed steps.
        
4.  **Image Generation** – For free models, run **Automatic1111** with **SDXL** or **ComfyUI** locally (you already have these via your paid subscription). Expose the generator via an HTTP endpoint so agents can call it. Use n8n to handle asynchronous requests and fallback to stock images if generation fails.
    
5.  **GitHub & VS Code** – Continue using GitHub for version control. VS Code (or Cursor) plus Qwen3‑Coder can generate code improvements on your repo. Set up CI workflows on Vercel or GitHub Actions to deploy the app automatically.
    
6.  **Containers & DevOps** – Use Docker Compose to spin up Supabase, n8n, CrewAI/MAF servers, and your AI models. Tools like **StackStorm** can monitor resource usage and restart services if they crash.
    
7.  **Monitoring & Alerting** – Implement health checks via StackStorm or Huginn. If an agent fails repeatedly (e.g., image generation), send an alert (e.g., Slack message).
    

### 5\. Leveraging Paid Subscriptions Judiciously

*   Your **Google One Pro** subscription gives access to Gemini Advanced, Veo, Imagen 4 and other high‑performance LLMs. Use these when free models fail or when you need higher quality (e.g., final marketing copy).
    
*   **ChatGPT Plus** provides GPT‑4 and upcoming GPT‑5; use these for brainstorming and planning tasks but rely on open models for execution.
    
*   **Automatic1111**, **ComfyUI**, and **Flux.1** are already in your stack for SDXL; they complement your open solutions.
    
*   Tools like **Abacus.ai**, **Openrouter**, **Cursor Pro**, **Replit Core** can be used for advanced experiments but should be secondary to open‑source foundations.
    

### 6\. High‑Level Workflow (Example)

1.  **Prepare Data & Baseline** – Migrate FRD/PFD and tasks into Supabase tables.
    
2.  **Set Up Orchestration Stack** – Deploy n8n, CrewAI/MAF, Qwen3‑Coder and DeepSeek on your local server (or cheap GPU cloud).
    
3.  **Define Agents** – Using CrewAI or MAF, implement the six BirthdayGen agent roles (Creative Director, Content Writer, Image Artist, Relationship Analyst, Delivery Coordinator, Quality Controller).
    
4.  **Build n8n Flows** – Create flows to:
    
    *   Trigger when a contact’s birthday is near.
        
    *   Call the agents via HTTP to generate text/images.
        
    *   Use Supabase functions to send the card (or Slack message).
        
    *   Update the database with status and logs.
        
5.  **Automate Testing & Validation** – Add QA agents that inspect the output; if quality is inadequate, they prompt the writer or artist agent for revisions.
    
6.  **Monitor & Iterate** – Use n8n’s run history and StackStorm monitors to track tasks. If you need to refine prompts or agent behaviours, update them and redeploy.
    

### Summary

By combining **n8n’s self‑hosted workflow automation capabilities** with **open‑source multi‑agent frameworks** like **CrewAI**, **Microsoft Agent Framework**, or **AutoGen**, and leveraging powerful open models such as **Qwen3‑Coder** and **DeepSeek‑V3.1**, you can build an autonomous system that runs BirthdayGen’s roadmap largely unattended. n8n provides the glue to connect your Supabase database, AI models, and external channels, while the agent frameworks handle complex creative and decision‑making tasks. Additional open‑source tools (Huginn, StackStorm, Activepieces) can fill specific automation gaps (event monitoring, DevOps operations, etc.). With careful integration and monitoring, this stack will allow you to walk away for hours while the project continues to make meaningful progress.undefined
